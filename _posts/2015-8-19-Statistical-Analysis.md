<h4>Problem: A/B Test. Testing an online forum and checking which variation of the forum netted the most quotes. Baseline was original, every other altercation afterwards was titled "Variation" with it's respective number. Testing baseline and 4 other variations so it's a fairly small 5x5 data set. Let's crunch the numbers and analyze this data set together.</h4>

I would ask you how did you control for time (time of day, which weekday, etc), and did you account for the fact that maybe the companies were just more desperate due to some lurking/extraneous factor? Since the goal is to have a variation which outputs the highest conversion rate, here are the analysis of my results: version 3 is the best, version 4 is second, baseline is third, version 1 is fourth, and version 2 is the worst.

If I were to run it again, I would consider removing variations that offered a conversion rate below the baseline, so leaving us with baseline, variation 3, and variation 4. Baseline and version 1 have very close results so I would run some more tests with that because as of now it is not easy to tell. 


## Potential problems with collecting data from forms
- The result might have to do with the time of day. 
- The day might matter as well
- Maybe they just needed it as an emergency

## Possible suggestions for improvement
- Controlling for time (time of day, weekday vs weekend)
- Obtain data on similar days (ex: Every Saturday)

## Potential Lurking Factors
- Internet disconnection being disabled while filling out a quote
- Website acting glitchy at moments of quote purchasing
